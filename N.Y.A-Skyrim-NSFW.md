First things first: this list contains adult content, and you must be of legal age in your country. This means 18+ in most countries, 21+ in others. It is up to you to be sure of the age requirement in your country.
Support and general talk about N.Y.A you can find on the following Discord: https://discord.gg/V38xZ6CtzQ


#### N.Y.A Mod List Version 2.0+
This list contains adult content, so you must be of legal age in your country to access it. In most countries, this means 18+, while in others, it’s 21+. Please ensure you meet the age requirement in your country.

The NSFW elements in this list are designed to be non-intrusive. NPCs will not be seen in overly revealing armor, and you won't encounter unwanted interactions like those in mods such as Troubles of Heroine. This version of N.Y.A runs on Skyrim version 1.6.640, and Wabbajack will automatically handle the downgrade for you. However, you will need the Anniversary Edition and the latest Skyrim version from Steam.

The mod list includes over 2,300 mods, resulting in a total size of over 650GB when downloaded and installed. A performance version is also available in the downloads folder for those looking to optimize performance. To save FPS, you can use the console command tg to remove grass.

We utilize the Pandora Behavior Engine, eliminating the need for Nemesis or FNIS. The list features over 110 monster mods and more than 30 combat mods. We use MCO + MCO Dodge and Stances, a system where each weapon type has four different animation sets. With the additional attack button, each weapon has a special attack. Additionally, you can purchase over 100 unique special attacks to customize your fighting style.

There are over 100 armor and clothing mods, comprising more than 2,500 individual pieces. These modded items can be found in chests throughout the open world. Unique bosses drop exclusive items upon defeat, adding an extra layer of challenge and reward.

Every possible graphical element has been enhanced. We use the Picho ENB to ensure the best visual experience. Explore a transformed Skyrim with this comprehensive mod list, blending enhanced gameplay, stunning visuals, and unique content to create an immersive and captivating experience.



#### Accounts
Nexus Account:
You will need a Nexus Account. Premium is recommended to avoid needing to manually click download many times and to get faster speeds.

Loverslab Login:
You can't log in to Loverslab through Wabbajack settings anymore. You have to log in when the first Loverslab mod pops up. If it works the first time, great. If not, only log in, then restart the install.

#### Manual Downloads
Wabbajack Bugs: Wabbajack has bugs downloading some mods. Download these mods manually before downloading the list with Wabbajack to avoid errors.

#### List of Mods:
Mods to Download Manually: https://github.com/Millionsfrost/N.Y.A-NSFW-Modlist-Skyrim/blob/main/Downloads.md

#### Mega Downloads:
Always right-click > Standard Download. Mega defaults to "Download as ZIP," which recompresses files and Wabbajack won't recognize them.

#### Download Folder:
Put all downloaded mods into the folder where you want the rest of the N.Y.A downloads to be stored. If you have an existing Skyrim mods downloads folder, use that to avoid downloading already existing mods.

#### Preparation:
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages:
Install this package, needed by MO2. If you’ve used MO2 before, you might already have it. If not, download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, and 2019".

Make sure you have the latest VC redistributable: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe. Its needet for Open Animation Replacer.

If you think you do, try updating anyway. They aren't distributed through Windows updates, but are often packed with programs and are updated along while installing. Can't really do that automatically with a SKSE plugin.

#### .NET Runtime:
Download and install the .NET runtime: Download .NET Runtime https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

#### Setup Your Page File:
Hold down the LEFT Windows key and press R.
Type systempropertiesadvanced in the run box and press ENTER.

Press "Set".
Press OK, then APPLY, then OK.
Restart your PC to apply the page file setting.

#### Setup Your Shader Cache:
Increase the shader cache size via Nvidia Control Panel to at least 10GB. For AMD users, similar steps might apply.

#### Antivirus Settings:
Exclude your Wabbajack folder and your NYA installation folder from your antivirus’ real-time protection. Disable or uninstall any third-party antivirus to avoid issues with usvfs_proxy_x86.exe.

#### Post Installation

Once you get into the game, Wait 30 seconds or until mods in the top right have disappeared
Press Escape and open up the MCM Menu go to Skyrim Unbound and Configure your starting options and Click Lets go when finished. Make your character. Once you finish your character. Click Stay Here on the prompt that follows. Another prompt will appear that will most of NYAs custom MCM settings automatically. (idk what the prompt says though or the option to click)  Wait again until its finished.

Now you can press enter and spawn in the gameworld. Then proceed to watch my Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pplMle5Tyd4&lc=UgxL2oGjoPVjsJft_5J4AaABAg for additional MCM settings not covered by the automatic MCM setup.


We also got Fill her up working again. In Sexlab MCM under Extra Effects you wanna change the option to Seperate Orgasms. Then Fill her up works again!

#### Manual Settings:
Set CompassCheat to 1. Then save, quit Skyrim, and reload your save. (If you want the compass back, the lore-friendly way is through Campfire Perks.)

Change the Hotkey from the Where are you MCM Menu for opening the Menu. The normal key is F3 and that interferes with our Stances Mod. So please rebind that. I use the Comma Key, and it works.

Later in the game, you can open the Int. Voiced Dirty Talk. Under Assign Voice, pick Voice Slot 1. Then a new screen opens. On the right side, manually enter the name of your character (beware of typos). In the top right, you can listen to samples. Under Assign Voice as Default, pick Voice 2 for females and for the male one, you can pick 1-8. Keep in mind this is an alpha patch, so not everything might work 100%. Dialogue options don’t work yet. You can also ignore all this and just don’t use this feature if you don’t like voices during scenes. This mod also has moaning and such, so you might want to use it. You can fiddle around with it as you want. Normally its setup correct if you are female but it cant hurt to double Check.

If you wanna fix High Heels in First person you need to go to Heels Fix MCM and go to Camera options and Correct first Person and Correct third Person.

The game defaults to Novice difficulty. Yet another Difficulty Mods makes the Game harder the more you level up, but you do start on Novice.

In the Sexcraft MCM you can change your Sex Key. Normally its Z for me, Y for Americans i think. Pressing Z will initiate Dialogue and Masturbate, holding Z is surrender to initiate Scenes with Enemies. Later when you get more Perks you can also click Z to steal Stuff in the Act and hold Z to drain Enemies.

#### NOTE:
DO NOT USE VANILLA as A START

#### Survival Mode
Do not use Survival Mode. It has been reported that with Survival, there are many freezes and issues causing the game to stop working.

#### Buttons
Z ( Y ) = Pressing Z will initiate Dialogue and Masturbate, holding Z is surrender to initiate Scenes with Enemies. Later when you get more Perks you can also click Z to steal Stuff in the Act and hold Z to drain Enemies.

You can disable the Curves Perk Weight Function in Sexcraft MCM or turn it on.

ß Button = Free Cam (Button next to 0, can be adjusted.)

Middle Mouse = Target Lock

H Button = Wheeler

, /comma = Where are you

G Button = Quick Light

C Button = Dodge Roll

V Button = Block

< Button = Additional Attack (Every weapon type has a special attack. If you equip an Ashes of War, the same button uses that. The < button is left of Y, in US cases, Z. You can change this in the Additional Attack MCM.)

L Button = Hunter's Pride (Turning this on and off lets you interact with downed enemies, taking actions like capturing them.)

ß Button = Free Cam (Button next to 0, can be adjusted. Lets you go into free cam in sex scenes or in general. Don’t use auto Freecam.)

#### INSTRUCTIONS FOR RIGHT HAND USERS:

In your Mod Manager, go to separator 24 - GAMEPLAY FRAMEWORK - and uncollapse to find "Dual Wield Parrying SKSE"

Right click on the mod and click "Open in Explorer." Click on SKSE folder and then the Plugins folder within. Finally open the "DualWieldParryingSKSE.ini".

In the .ini file, modify "ParryKey2 = 257" to "ParryKey2 = 1000000" and save.

Launch the game and bring up the Skyrim Settings -> Controls.

If you are used to "Left Mouse Button (LMB)" being the "Right Hand" (Right handed users) feel free to map LMB to "Right Hand"

If you followed the above step, you may prefer to use M1 (LMB) instead of M2 (RMB) In "One Click Power Attack" -> "Main Settings" -> "Right Power Attack" -> "Key"

Below steps make block/parry be functional for our dual weapon wielding enthusiasts. Disregard if not interested

In your Mod Manager, go to separator 24 - GAMEPLAY FRAMEWORK - and uncollapse to find "Dual Wield Parrying SKSE"

Right click on the mod and click "Open in Explorer." Click on SKSE folder and then the Plugins folder within. Finally open the "DualWieldParryingSKSE.ini".

In the .ini file, modify "ParryKey = x" where x is the key of your preference. Refer to: https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/DirectX_Scancodes_And_How_To_Use_Them
(I recommend 257/Right Mouse Button which is default for block)

Feel free to edit or remove second parry key or modifiers, there is no harm leaving it as is.

Now, go to "One Click Power Attack"  and tick "Main Settings" -> "Misc" -> "Disable block key."

WARNING THIS WILL REMOVE YOUR "LEFT HAND" FROM SKYRIM VANILLA CONTROL OPTIONS, IF YOU WISH TO REVERT IT, JUST RESET IT TO DEFAULTS USING "T."

If you no longer wish to dual wield weapons, you have to do the above step to get your "Left hand" option enabled again.

#### SexLab+
This list uses SexLab+, a newer version of SexLab.

#### Note:
Sexlab+ and Pandora are in an alpha state, so some features dont work perfectly yet.


#### Simple Super Ultrawide (32:9) Guide
Created for N.Y.A. This only applies if you have a 32:9 super ultrawide monitor.

1. DDD:
Download and Install Flawless Widescreen and Enable the Skyrim SE Plugin.
Turn off and remove all Camera Mods (Customizable Camera, 3rd Person Camera Overhaul, etc.) from the game. You need the default vanilla camera, otherwise, this will not work.

2. FWS:
Launch the game.
Enable the Skyrim SE Plugin under Installed Plugins.
Change display resolution, aspect ratio, and other settings to match your monitor. Set HUD Safezone Adjustment to 0.800 (this adjusts HUD elements to stay within viewable area).
Press Apply.
Close FWS.
Adjust SkyrimPrefs.ini to support 32:9 Aspect Ratio (located in C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition).

Find:

[Display]
iSize H=
iSize W=

Replace with:

[General]
fdefaultfov=95
fdefaultworldfov=95
fdefault1stpersonfov=95

Adjust FOV (Field of View) by adding or changing the following lines in Skyrim.ini (located in the same folder):

[General]
fdefaultfov=95
fdefaultworldfov=95
fdefault1stpersonfov=95
Adjust any other settings based on your personal preferences and hardware capabilities.

3. SSME:
(Optional) Download and install Skyrim Startup Memory Editor (SSME) to enhance game performance by managing memory allocation better.
Launch SSME and configure memory settings based on your system's RAM. The general rule is to allocate half of your available RAM to Skyrim. For example, if you have 16GB of RAM, allocate 8192MB (8GB) to Skyrim.
Save and close SSME.

4. Ultrawide UI Fixes:
Install a mod like Complete Widescreen Fix for Vanilla and SkyUI 2.2 and 5.2 SE to fix UI elements on super ultrawide screens. This will ensure menus and other UI elements display correctly.

5. ENB:
If using an ENB, adjust the aspect ratio settings in the enblocal.ini file located in the main Skyrim SE folder to support 32:9 aspect ratio.
Find:

[FIX]
ForceBorderlessFullscreen=
ForceBorderless=

Replace with:

[FIX]
ForceBorderlessFullscreen=true
ForceBorderless=true

Save and close the file.

6. Enjoy:
Launch Skyrim SE and enjoy the game in glorious super ultrawide 32:9. Adjust in-game settings as necessary to ensure the best performance and visual quality.
