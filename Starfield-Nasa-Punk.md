# Pre-installation Steps

- STEAM version of Starfield (No GamePass/Microsoft Support). DO NOT ASK FOR MY HELP WITH A PIRATED VERSION
- Version 1.13.61 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and do NOT ever update until a newer version of Star Wars Genesis releases
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14.40.33810.0 (Most PCâ€™s have this but please make sure)
- Fresh Save (even V4 users) (NG+ does NOT count)
- Language set to English otherwise none of the text replacement mods will work. Check for translations on NexusMods










## Requirements
Verify that your system meets the recommended requirement for running the modlist. Having a "worse" computer than this will not stop you from playing, but being below these requirements will likely result in performance issues.

#### Page File and Shader Cache
You will need to manually increase your page file as well as increase the size of your shader cache in order to avoid performance issues, even if you have a monster PC.

To increase your page file, press Windows+R and enter **systempropertiesadvanced** into it. Under "Performance", click "Settings..." and swap to the Advanced tab. Here you want to click "Change" under virtual memory.


Uncheck "Automatically manage..." and select your fastest SSD in the list of drives. Check "Custom Size" and set **Initial Size to 20480** and set **Maximum Size to 40000**. Now press "Set" and then APPLY before restarting your PC.


Increase the shader cache size via Nvidia Control Panel to at least **10GB**. For AMD users, similar steps might apply.
