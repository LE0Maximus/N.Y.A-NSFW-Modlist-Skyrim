Support and general talk about N.Y.A you can find on the following Discord: https://discord.gg/V38xZ6CtzQ

Please read this: https://github.com/LivelyDismay/magnum-opus/blob/main/README.md

It is important you do the Steps to make Magnum Opus running, since this List is based upon it. Post Installation will be covered on this Page.



#### Sandland-SFW-Modlist-Fallout 4

Release Beta Test Version of Sandland, you need the latest Next gen Update from Fallout 4.



#### Accounts

In terms of accounts you will need: Nexus Account, Premium would be best.

ALSO WARNING: You cant login anymore into Loverslab in the Wabbajack Settings. You have todo it now when the first Loverslab Mod pop up, you need to login over the Windows that pops up. If it works for you first time, good, if not only Login then restart the Install.
So yeah there are like 2 Mods from Loverslab, a Skin mod, and a Physics Mod.


#### Please download the Mods Manually before Downloading the List with Wabbajack. Sometimes you will likely get lots of Errors and Stuff, and if you manually downloads these Things you can avoid some Headaches.

FSM Skin Textures( Warning Nudity ) : https://www.loverslab.com/topic/171099-fsm-body-textures-redux-extreme-backup-of-deleted-mods-from-nexusmods/ 
( Download the left File on the Bottom , the one with more Downloads )

OCBPC Physics : https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18605-ocbpc-for-fallout-4/ 
( Only 1 File to download here )



#### Nexus Premium Account

LoversLab Account - for manual downloads through your browser.



#### Installation

I would heavily recommend that you download the LoversLab mods in your browser prior to running Wabbajack. Doing this may be long winded but can prevent a lot of issues from happening. All links to mods hosted on LoversLab can be found above.


#### Preparation

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages
This package is a must as it is needed by MO2 - you may already have it if you've used MO2 before. If you do not have it, you want to download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019".



#### Download Visual C++ Redistributable Package and the Thing underneath it.

Also get the Thing underneath, i think it was needet for Sexlab+.

#### Setup your Page File

You should setup a pagefile of at least 20GB - yes, even if you have a million GB of RAM. To setup your pagefile;

Hold down the LEFT Windows key and press R
Type in systempropertiesadvanced in the run box and then press ENTER
Under the "Performance" option, click the "Settings..." button
Switch to the "Advanced" tab
Under "Virtual Memory", click the "Change..." button
Uncheck Automatically manage... if it's checked
Select your fastest SSD in the list of drives
Check "Custom Size"
Set Initial Size to 20480
Set Maximum Size to 40000
Press the "Set" button
Press OK
Press APPLY and then OK
Restart your PC to apply the pagefile setting

AMD USERS: See this link for some manual tweaks that may or may not help.

#### Setup your Antivirus
Before you go down the route of "I don't have an antivirus" - you do, it's built into Windows. You need to exclude your Wabbajack folder and your WoD installation folder from your antivirus' real-time protection stuff as it will likely interfere with your install and worst case, it can remove files, ruining your install. It can and will interfere whilst you are playing too, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering.

How do I do this, you ask? Click here to find out how.

Note: If you're using Webroot or any other free 3rd party antivirus it's likely that adding the folders to exclusions will not be enough and you'll need to disable or uninstall your 3rd party AV as they can incorrectly mark usvfs_proxy_x86.exe, among other files, as a virus, a file needed for Mod Organizer 2 to work. We recommend doing so anyway in case it's a free one, as Windows Defender is likely much better at stopping threats than that is (according to data from av-test.org https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/).



#### Disable Steam Overlay

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues when using ENBs. I recommend you turn it off to be sure that it doesn't interfere in any way and you can do so by heading into Steam, right clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library and clicking Properties > General > Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game".



#### Set game language to English

Wabbajack and the modding tools out there only support English language versions of games. Setting the language to English in Steam will stop issues like Wabbajack file verification failures when installing. As with disabling the overlay, right click on Skyrim Special Edition in your game library and click Properties > Language > Select English.



#### Change Steam's Updating Behavior

If for some reason Bethesda decide to release an update for Skyrim, everything will probably break. Well, not everything but something will definitely break until mods can be updated to suit. To stop this from happening, you need to tell Steam that you only want to update when you tell it to. You can do this by right clicking on Skyrim in your game library and clicking Properties > Updates > Change Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it". Whilst you're in here, it's also recommended to disable Steam Cloud too.



#### Start Fallout 4

That's right - start the game. You need to let the game do its initial start up jobs such as creating registry entries and generating default config files. Once you've gotten to the main menu you can close the game again.



#### Wabbajack

Installing the list is straight forward, Wabbajack will do most of the heavy lifting for you - you only have to tell it where to put stuff.

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like C:\WoD. Do not install it to one of the protected folders as mentioned earlier. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too - ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location, or if you have multiple Skyrim Special Edition modlists installed, use a common download folder - this will stop you from having to redownload common mods across multiple modlists.

Once you have everything set in Wabbajack, hit GO and let it do its thing. It might take a while as there is a fair bit to download and the speed of this will depend on your internet performance as well as your CPU in the later stages for hashing and unpacking the downloads.



#### Please read very carefully from here on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After you start the Game, and made your Character, wait in the Room until all the Things are initiliazed. Once done, the Coice is yours, i prefer Vault 111 Start. When you are in the Game World, please open MCM Menu and go to MCM Settings and RUN the Sandland Preset, then you are done.



#### Survival Mode

I dont know if it works, but it probably will.



#### Buttons

Middle Mouse out of Combat = Masturbation, but also you can try to seduce People while looking at them via your Sexcraft Perk Tree. ( You can change Sexcraft Key via Console Command, how to is on Sexcraft Modpage. )

ß Button = Free Cam ( Button next after 0, can be adjustet. -> -_ Button = Free Cam ( Button next after 0, can be adjusted. For Sexlab/Scenes.

Middle Mouse = Target Lock

G Button = Quick Light

C Button = Dodge Roll

V Button = Block

< Button = Additional Attack ( Every Weapon Type has a Special Attack, if you equip an Ashes of War, same Button uses that. < Button is left of Y, in US cases Z i think. You can change this in the Additional Attack MCM.

L Button = Hunters Pride ( Turning this on and off lets you do things to downed Enemies )

ß Button = Free Cam ( Button next after 0, can be adjustet. Lets you go into free Cam in Sex Scene, or well in general. Dont use auto Freecam.
