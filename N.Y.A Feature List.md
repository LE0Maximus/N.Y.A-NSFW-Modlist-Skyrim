## Obody HotSwap Collisions

We now use OBody HotSwap - CBPC presets for OBody, meaning and i quote from the Authoe " The same thing CBPC CCC does (and something extra), but for all supported presets you load via OBody.
In few words, if the preset is included in CBPC CCC's supported list then it can get its own custom collisions, tuned to the shape of that body. The "something extra" is to not only allow collisions but custom bounce configs as well.
Supported Body Presets atm are the following:

D-sney Mommy - 3BA Edition - Bodyslide Preset
Pomona Amphora Bodyslide Preset for CBBE-3BA-3BBB and BHUNP
Elven Supremacy Preset (CBBE 3BA)
My Lovely Body - Sexy Beauty - CBBE 3BA Bodyslide Preset
Diamond Body 3BA - Bodyslide Preset
Lovely Lady - 3BA (3BBB) CBBE Bodyslide Preset
My Sensual Body - CBBE 3BA Bodyslide Preset
Ceres Deluge BodySlide Preset for 3BA BHUNP CBBE COCO 3BBB
Greek Goddess - Bodyslide and Racemenu Preset - CBBE-3BA-3BBB
Demonic Bodyslide Preset CBBE 3BA and BHUNP Nemesisoll post
The Luscious Body - CBBE 3BA Bodyslide Preset
Dominion Body (3BA preset)
Sonderbain's Waifu Bodyslide - Kaisel 3BA
THE P3ACH -CBBE Preset-

I also added them into the Obody Preset thingy, so basicly NPCS can only get these Presets applied to them. All the other Presets are basicly only applicable manually, or for the Player. Check out Obody HotSwap to learn more! More Presets will be added every Week.




More to come! Maybe!
